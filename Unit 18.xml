<i_t>Unit introduction</i_t>
<i_te>Computers influence much of the world around us and are used to solve a range of problems, including complex problems such as generating the visual effects in films and landing the Curiosity Rover (unmanned robot) on Mars. Computational thinking enables us to solve these problems using mathematics and logic.</i_te>
<i_te>Therefore, computational thinking skills are required extensively in any IT/computing career. Employability skills, such as communication, numeracy and teamwork, are also important in the workplace.</i_te>
<i_te>Some of these skills occur naturally within other units in the BTEC in Information and Creative Technology. However, this unit provides a coherent and formalised introduction to computational thinking. In this unit you will understand some of the mathematical methods, such as Boolean operations and functions, that underpin computational thinking skills used to solve problems. There are three types of computational thinking skills, specifically:</i_te>
<ol type="i_nl1">
<li>Logical thinking is about using readily available information to solve problems without making assumptions or taking short cuts and to check the validity of the result. The number puzzle Sudoku is an example of a problem which can be solved this way.</li>
<li>Algorithmic thinking involves using a predefined set of instructions to solve problems. For example, in strategy games like noughts and crosses or chess, players will use set moves (instructions) to try to gain advantage over their opponent and win.</li>
<li>Optimal thinking involves refining one of the many possible solutions to a problem to make it more efficient, i.e. the quickest and/or most effective method to obtain the desired result. For example, completing the Towers of Hanoi or a Rubik&#8217;s Cube puzzle using the fewest moves.</li>
</ol>
<i_te>In this unit you will use computational thinking (logical, algorithmic and optimal), underpinned by mathematical methods, to solve a problem.</i_te>
<i_te>This unit supports all of the optional units in the BTEC in Information and Creative Technology qualification.</i_te>
<la_t>Learning aims </la_t>

<tg_st>Resources</tg_st>
<tg_te>Learners will need access to a computer system with a spreadsheet package. </tg_te>
<tg_te>If not provided by the spreadsheet, graphing facilities capable of satisfying the outcomes described will need to be available. A good range of case study examples and exercises is needed.</tg_te>
<tg_st>Assessment guidance</tg_st>
<tg_te>This unit is assessed internally by the centre and externally verified by Edexcel. Please read this guidance in conjunction with </tg_te><tg_te_e>Section 8 Internal assessment</tg_te_e><tg_te>.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners will be familiar with the content of the National Curriculum programme of study for mathematics in Key Stage 3.</tg_te>
<tg_te>It is suggested that this unit is assessed using a series of assignments.</tg_te>
<tg_te>It may be appropriate to use prepared exercises to provide evidence for some of the criteria in this unit, but it is recommended that, where possible, these be set to a vocational context. It is not expected that the assignments should be completed under controlled conditions.</tg_te>
<tg_te>If any exercises are used to provide evidence then outcomes should be considered against the assessment criteria rather than the award of a grade or numeric mark.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Where the unit content asks for a particular set of calculations to be completed, then all calculations must be completed successfully by individual learners and workings must be shown where appropriate. </tg_te>
<tg_te>Although some of this unit will be evidenced on paper or using a spreadsheet, centres should consider the use of assessment methods such as presentations, posters, leaflets, videos and podcasts. The use of these methods will allow assignments to be set in vocational contexts.</tg_te>
<tg_te>All three learning outcomes could be assessed in a similar way, with learners producing material for technical audiences specified by learners or the teacher.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners should use evidence from this unit as part of the learner&#8217;s digital portfolio </tg_te><tg_te_e>(Unit 3: A Digital Portfolio)</tg_te_e><tg_te>.</tg_te>
<tg_h1>Learning aim A</tg_h1>
<tg_te>It is important for learners to understand the purpose and uses of calculations as part of the fundamental concepts of computational thinking. Learners are expected to demonstrate how to use calculations by using appropriate mathematical methods to find solutions to a set of given problems. Learners need to be familiar with working with different types of numbers, including natural, integer, real and binary. Most learners may be less familiar with binary and hexadecimal number systems and may need to spend additional time working with them.</tg_te>
<ac_te_s>For 2A.P1:</ac_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to explain the computational uses of calculations and use calculations to write numbers using power notation. Therefore, they need to be familiar with numbers raised by powers and numbers expressed in scientific notation (standard form). Learners need to be given sufficient opportunities to practise the use of these numbers to ensure that they are comfortable with them. Teachers may wish to concentrate on working with powers of two in order to support the work with binary numbers later in the unit.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners are required to use calculations to convert positive decimal numbers to binary and hexadecimal number systems. Decimal numbers should be from 1 to 63.</tg_te>
<tg_te_e>For level 1, as a minimum, learners should identify the computational uses of calculations and use calculations to write numbers using power notation. Learners will also convert positive decimal numbers (in the range of 1 to 63) to binary and hexadecimal.</tg_te_e>
<tg_te_e>They are likely to need some assistance with these activities.</tg_te_e>
<ac_te_s>For 2A.M1:</ac_te_s><tg_te> Learners need to be aware that using technology to carry out calculations can introduce errors, such as the rounding of numbers during calculations due to the amount of memory available to store the numbers. Learners should be able to use calculations to identify rounding errors.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners should concentrate on using an 8-bit representation to demonstrate how numbers from 1 to 63 can be represented in computer memory. Their previous work on powers of two should support these activities.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners are required to use calculations to convert between all the three number systems, including binary to hexadecimal and hexadecimal to decimal.</tg_te>
<tg_te_s>For 2A.D1:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to discuss how integers and real numbers can be represented in computer memory. Therefore, they should be able to represent real numbers in two&#8217;s complement format and be able to explain the purpose of two&#8217;s complement representations in computer memory. Real numbers can be converted to binary and represented in computer memory.</tg_te>
<tg_h1>Learning aim B</tg_h1>
<tg_te>It is important for learners to understand the purpose and uses of functions and Boolean operations as part of the fundamental concepts of computational thinking. Learners are expected to demonstrate how to use functions and Boolean operations by using appropriate mathematical methods to find solutions to a set of given problems. </tg_te>
<tg_te_s>For 2B.P2:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to explain the computational uses of functions and identify linear and quadratic functions. Learners should be presented with a series of simple problems such as &#8216;Two brothers bought ten pens. If one brother bought four pens, calculate how many pens were bought by the other brother.&#8217; Learners should practise expressing these problems as functions.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners are also required to obtain the equation of a straight line from a graph. Therefore, learners need to develop their skills in the use of coordinates to allow them to describe a given straight line on a graph in terms of y = mx + c. Learners should gain experience of lines with both positive and negative gradients and different y-axis incepts.</tg_te>
<tg_te_e>For level 1, as a minimum, learners should identify the computational uses of functions and use functions to identify linear functions, and obtain the function of a straight line from a graph. </tg_te_e>
<tg_te_e>They are likely to need some assistance with these activities.</tg_te_e>
<tg_te_s>For 2B.M2:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to use software to represent and define the range and domain of different types of linear and quadratic functions. Therefore, learners should be able to use software to represent a range of applications for different types of functions. Learners should consider the practical applications for these functions.</tg_te>
<tg_te_s>For 2B.D2:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to discuss how functions are used in programming output to screen-based devices. Therefore, they should be able to demonstrate an understanding of how functions are used to produce designs for screen layouts. They should also be able to explain how the mathematical concepts are used to create and position objects, such as circles, on screen.</tg_te>
<tg_te_s>For 2B.P3:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to explain the computational uses of Boolean operations and produce truth tables and logic gates corresponding to at least three different operations. Therefore, learners should become familiar with the range of Boolean operations given in the unit content. In many cases learners may find it easier to relate these operations to real-life situations to understand the output related to the inputs. For example, if searching for boys who are more than 11 years old then an AND operation would be TRUE if the input was &#8216;boy&#8217; and &#8216;12&#8217; and FALSE if the input was &#8216;boy&#8217; and &#8216;10&#8217;. Learners should be able to draw up truth tables for each of the operations. </tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners should be introduced to the practical use of Boolean operations through the construction of logic gates. They need to appreciate that logic gates can have several inputs but only one output.</tg_te>
<tg_te_e>For level 1, as a minimum, learners should identify the computational uses of Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) and produce truth tables and logic gates corresponding to at least two different operations. They are likely to need some assistance with these activities.</tg_te_e>
<tg_te_s>For 2B.M3:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to use more complex Boolean operations to produce truth tables and logic gates corresponding to at least </tg_te><tg_te_s>three</tg_te_s><tg_te> different combinations of operations in series. Therefore, learners need to be able to produce truth tables that represent the use of a combination of Boolean operations.</tg_te>
<tg_te_s>For 2B.D3:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are required to use logic gates to solve simple problems. Therefore, learners should be able to demonstrate that they can solve problems that involve multiple inputs (at least </tg_te><tg_te_s>three</tg_te_s><tg_te>) and represent more complex processes. For example, this combination of NOT, AND and OR gates has three inputs: A, B and C. The outputs from the NOT and AND gates are combined through the OR gate to give the final output Z. A NOT gate has just one input. NOT gates are often used in emergency-stop buttons on machine tools. If an OR gate is used in a simple lighting circuit with two switches in parallel, the lamp will light if either switch is pressed. If an AND gate was used, both switches would have to be pressed at the same time.</tg_te>
<tg_h1>Learning aim C</tg_h1>
<tg_te>Learners will now relate the theory and application of different mathematical methods of calculations, functions and Boolean operations to solve a given problem by using computational thinking. Learners should have access to a suitable assessment brief, which outlines the problem.</tg_te>
<tg_te>Learners should apply logical thinking skills to solve a problem. Examples of problems could include:</tg_te>
<ul type="tg_bl1">
<li>defining the nth term in a number sequence based on a practical problem</li>
<li>combining logic gates to analyse data and provide correct output</li>
<li>allocating network addresses to hosts (computers), routers, servers and switches using number systems</li>
<li>designing control systems, including the way routers and switches organise traffic using logic gates.</li>
</ul>
<tg_te>Learners should also apply algorithmic thinking skills to solve a problem. Examples of problems could include:</tg_te>
<ul type="tg_bl1">
<li>solving equations</li>
<li>plotting graphs of linear and quadratic functions</li>
<li>applying file permissions on web servers and other networked file systems</li>
<li>calculating the route taken for data to travel across the network using linear and quadratic functions </li>
<li>the route taken by the data, represented by linear and quadratic functions.</li>
</ul>
<tg_te>Learners should also apply optimal thinking skills to solve a problem. Examples of problems could include:</tg_te>
<ul type="tg_bl1">
<li>refine algorithms to carry out procedures in the fewest possible steps</li>
<li>perfective maintenance of a computer program.</li>
</ul>
<tg_te_s>For 2C.P4:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners should design a solution to the given problem. The design documentation should include:</tg_te>
<ul type="tg_bl1">
<li>a description of the problem divided into smaller sub-problems (as required)</li>
<li>appropriate visualisation tools to represent the problem, e.g. flow chart, logic gate diagrams</li>
<li>mathematical methods to represent a possible solution.</li>
</ul>
<tg_te_e>For level 1, as a minimum, learners should design a solution to the given problem, and will need some assistance with this activity. The proposed solution will contain:</tg_te_e>
<ul type="tg_bl1">
<li></li><tg_te_e>a description of the problem divided into smaller sub-problems (as required)</tg_te_e>
<tg_te_e>&#3913;	visualisation tools to represent the problem</tg_te_e>
</ul>
<ac_te_e>&#3913;	</ac_te_e><tg_te_e>mathematical </tg_te_e><ac_te_e>methods to represent a possible solution.</ac_te_e>
<tg_te_s>For 2C.M4:</tg_te_s><tg_te> in addition to the requirements for the pass grade, learners should produce a detailed solution to a problem using:</tg_te>
<ul type="tg_bl1">
<li>alternative solutions, e.g. using different mathematical methods, for example by using different functions</li>
<li>test data (containing normal, extreme and erroneous values) to demonstrate the validity of the result.</li>
</ul>
<tg_te_s>For 2C.D4:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners are expected to be able to justify their design decisions, including a justification of how it will solve the problem, and to explain any design constraints.</tg_te>
<tg_te_s>For 2C.P5:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners should create a model of the solution. Learners should test their model for functionality and repair any faults.</tg_te>
<tg_te>For a pass grade, the model may not produce a valid result in all cases/situations.</tg_te>
<tg_te_e>For level 1, as a minimum, learners should create a model of the solution and test the model for functionality. They are likely to need support with this activity.</tg_te_e>
<tg_te_s>For 2C.M5:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners should create a functional model which solves the problem and use test data to demonstrate the validity of the solution. Learners are likely to need to adapt their designs to create a fully functioning model.</tg_te>
<tg_te_s>For 2C.D5:</tg_te_s><tg_te> learners should use optimal thinking to refine their model &#8211; for example, make the solution more efficient, i.e. the quickest and/or most effective way to obtain the desired result.</tg_te>
