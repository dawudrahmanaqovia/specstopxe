                        <h2>Unit introduction</h2>
                        <p>Computers influence much of the world around us and are used to solve a range of
                        problems, including complex problems such as generating the visual effects in films
                        and landing the Curiosity Rover (unmanned robot) on Mars. Computational thinking enables
                        us to solve these problems using mathematics and logic.</p>
                        
                        <p>Therefore, computational thinking skills are required extensively in any IT/computing
                        career. Employability skills, such as communication, numeracy and teamwork, are also
                        important in the workplace.</p>
                        
                        <p>Some of these skills occur naturally within other units in the BTEC in Information
                        and Creative Technology. However, this unit provides a coherent and formalised introduction
                        to computational thinking. In this unit you will understand some of the mathematical
                        methods, such as Boolean operations and functions, that underpin computational thinking
                        skills used to solve problems. There are three types of computational thinking skills,
                        specifically:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Logical thinking is about using readily available information to solve problems
                        without making assumptions or taking short cuts and to check the validity of the result.
                        The number puzzle Sudoku is an example of a problem which can be solved this way.</li>
                        <li>Algorithmic thinking involves using a predefined set of instructions to solve
                        problems. For example, in strategy games like noughts and crosses or chess, players
                        will use set moves (instructions) to try to gain advantage over their opponent and
                        win.</li>
                        <li>Optimal thinking involves refining one of the many possible solutions to a problem
                        to make it more efficient, i.e. the quickest and/or most effective method to obtain
                        the desired result. For example, completing the Towers of Hanoi or a Rubik’s Cube
                        puzzle using the fewest moves.</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>In this unit you will use computational thinking (logical, algorithmic and optimal),
                        underpinned by mathematical methods, to solve a problem.</p>
                        
                        <p>This unit supports all of the optional units in the BTEC in Information and Creative
                        Technology qualification.</p>
